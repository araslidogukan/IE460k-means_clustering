**K-MEANS CLUSTERING**

This repository includes implementations of k-means and bisecting k-means algorithms from scratch on Python using numpy library.

For an efficient runtime, implementations heavily rely on numpy broadcasting. "main.py" shows how to save sse's and convergence times for different k values.
